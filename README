# angularjs-chromeextension-shadowdom

This is a simple Chrome Extension demonstrating the use of the
Shadow DOM with AngularJS.

Every minute, the [event
page](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/event_pages) will
send a message to the [content
script](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts),
which will cause the contents of the shadow root to alternate
between the host page and a "Hello, world!" message.
